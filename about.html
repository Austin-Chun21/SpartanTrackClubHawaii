                    <p>The Spartan Track Club was established in 2019 to promote and grow the sport of track and field in Hawaii. We sought 
                        to provide runners of all levels with opportunities to improve their times, form, and athletic capability. Initially, 
                        our team primarily consisted of sprinters along with a few distance runners. Since then, our team has expanded to include athletes 
                        in almost every event. Our Level I and II USATF certified coaches work to provide optimal training for our athletes to ensure they 
                        succeed in any event. They have extensive experience guiding and preparing runners, throwers, and jumpers of all skill levels. Read 
                        more about our team below.</p>

                                <h5>Kyle Davis</h5>
                                <p>This is Kyle’s 6th year at Maryknoll, where he currently serves as an AP Biology and Human Anatomy & Physiology teacher at the high school.
                                    In 2011 Kyle moved from Bethlehem, PA to Oahu and took a position as the lead science teacher at Kamaile Academy Public Charter School in Waianae. In 2013 he accepted the position of head coach for cross-country and track & field for Island Pacific Academy. In his two seasons at the helm, he helped several athletes achieve ILH medals and qualify for the state championship meets.
                                    <br><p>Prior to moving to Hawaii in 2011, Kyle had spent 12 years coaching track and field in both New Jersey and Pennsylvania. He earned his USATF Level I coaching certification in 2003 and his Level II certification in 2011 (specialization in jumping events). At the high school level, he has coached numerous athletes to league, district, and state titles in various events. From 2003 through 2006 he also served as the jumps coach for DeSales University. 
                                    In addition to coaching track & field, Kyle also served as the head strength and conditioning coach for all varsity sports at Nazareth High School in PA. His depth of knowledge in kinesiology and biomechanics has allowed him to produce many student athletes who earned full athletic scholarships in football, basketball, track & field, volleyball, and swimming.
                                    Kyle is married to Katie Davis, who is an elementary art teacher at Island Pacific academy. They live with their beagles, Maddy (R.I.P Sophie) in Kapolei. He enjoys spending time surfing, hiking and exercising, reading about science, nerdy science fiction/fantasy books, and looks forward to the challenge of building a high quality cross country and track & field program here at Maryknoll.</p>
